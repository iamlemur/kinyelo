Setup Instructions
------------------------

Make sure Java 1.7+ is installed and available from the command line (check by running 'java -version')

1. Make sure you have a hosts entry on the host machine that matches your choice for the hostname in the Vagrantfile for the guest machine
10.8.8.8 is the IP. To do this on a Mac, open Terminal and navigate to the /private/etc/hosts file.
2. Install VirtualBox
3. Install Vagrant
4. Open the terminal and navigate to the deployed directory, then run: vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest


cd ./plovr
curl -O https://plovr.googlecode.com/files/plovr-81ed862.jar
mv plovr-81ed862.jar plovr.jar
cd ../

cd /var/tmp
curl -LO https://github.com/google/closure-library/archive/master.zip
unzip master.zip
mv closure-library-master/closure/goog/ <<project directory>>/public/js/goog/


-------------------------
Starting up the server
-------------------------
From here down, run these commands every time in the deployed directory when starting up

In one terminal window, navigate to the deployed directory then the subdirectory 'plovr' and run the command:
java -jar plovr.jar serve kinyelo-config.js
This will start the server that serves the compiled Google Closure JavaScript

In another terminal window, navigate to the deployed directory and run the command:
vagrant up (this will take a while the first time)
This will start up the virtual machine and then return to the bash prompt
