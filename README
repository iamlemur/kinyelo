Setup Instructions
------------------------

Make sure Java 1.7+ is installed

1. Make sure you have a hosts entry on the host machine that matches your choice for the hostname in the Vagrantfile for the guest machine
10.8.8.8 is the IP. To do this on a Mac, open Terminal and navigate to the /private/etc/hosts file.
2. Install VirtualBox and create a new virtual machine... [Michael?]
3. Install Vagrant
4. Open the terminal and navigate to the deployed directory, then run: vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest
5. In the deployed directory, run chmod -R 777 ./app/storage/

cd ./plovr
curl -O https://plovr.googlecode.com/files/plovr-81ed862.jar
mv plovr-81ed862.jar plovr.jar
cd ../

-------------------------
Starting up the server
-------------------------
from here down run every time in the deployed directory
java -jar ./plovr/plovr.jar serve ./plovr/kinyelo-config.js

run: vagrant up (this will take a while)
