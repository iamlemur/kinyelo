h1. Setup Instructions

1. Make sure you have a hosts entry on the host machine that matches your choice for the hostname in the Vagrantfile for the guest machine
10.8.8.8 is the IP. To do this on a Mac, open Terminal and navigate to the /private/etc/hosts file.
2. Install VirtualBox and create a new virtual machine... [Michael?]
3. Install Vagrant
4. Open the terminal and navigate to the deployed directory
